# Simple Bank App

This is my first go REST application


I do this because I want to learn Go.

# Notes:

During the course the following question arised:

### How will we talk to the db?
See: [DB_ORMs.md](docs%2FDB_ORMs.md)

**TL;DR:** We will use SQLC. It's a command that uses a pseudo language 
to create go code that speaks with the DB
